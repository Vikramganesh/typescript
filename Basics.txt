Typescript:

------> open source and pure object-oriented
------> superset of java script
------> Designed for large scale applications
------> ES6 version of Java script
------> strongly typed language means explicitly convert data types.
------> supports static typing,stongly type,modules,optional parameters.

   TypeScript cannot run directly on browser.It need a compailer to run .ts.
   That compiler name is TSC.This TSC compailes the .ts file and convert to .js file

Advantages & Disadvantages:

   ADV:
       -> Highlights errors at compilation time (javascript runtime errors shows)
       -> strongly typed programming language.
       -> runs on any browser
   DISADV:
       -> takes long time to compile the code


Diferences js & ts:

      JS:
         -> weekly typed programming language
         -> it just scripting language
         -> highlights error at run time
         -> Does not support modules
         -> Does not support generics.
      TS: 
         -> strongly typed programming language
         -> pure object oriented language
         -> highlights error at compile time
         -> support modules
         -> support generics.

Components of typescript:
      typescript is internally divided into three main layers.
      these layers are divided into sublayers or components.
      these layers are:
        * Language
        * Typescript Compiler
        * Typescript language services: which helps editors and other tools to 
          give better assistance features such as intellisens like code formating
          colorization, statement completion, signature help, etc.

Install TypeScript:
       we require: 
                   * IDE
                   * Nodejs
                   * Npm
                   * Typescript
       > npm install -g typescript
       > tsc -v
       > npm install -g typescript@latest (install latest version of typescript)
       > tsc hello.ts (to run typescript file).

Type Anotation in TypeScript:
          Type Annotations are annotations which can be placed anywhere when we use 
          a type. The use of Type annotation is not mandatory in TypeScript. 
          It helps the compiler in checking the types of variable and avoid errors
          when dealing with the data types.


TypeScript Variables:

   variables can be declared using : var, let, const.
   ----> var:
           Any variable declared with 
           the var keyword inside of a function is a local variable.
   ----> let:
             variables declared using "let" have a block scope.the scope of let variables is
             limited to their containing block,
             Eg: function, if-else block, loop blocks.
  -----> const:
             the const makes a variable a constant where its value canot be changed.
